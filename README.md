# Inspecting Restaurant Inspections – Using Machine Learning to Improve Sanitation in NYC
Repository for Master's degree capstone project predicting NYC restaurant inspection grades from past inspection data.

## Navigation
The code notebooks in this respository are found in the [code](https://github.com/seanmurphy21/capstone_project/blob/main/code) folder.  

#### Data Preprocessing Code
The data preprocessing code is found [here](https://github.com/seanmurphy21/capstone_project/blob/main/code/data_preprocessing.ipynb).

#### Feature Engineering and EDA Code
The feature engineering and EDA code is found [here](https://github.com/seanmurphy21/capstone_project/blob/main/code/eda_feature_engineering.ipynb).

#### Modeling Code
The modeling code is found [here](https://github.com/seanmurphy21/capstone_project/blob/main/code/modeling.ipynb)

#### Data
The data for this project is publicly available, and can be downloaded as a .csv file from [this link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j/about_data).  This data set is read in to our preprocessing code as '../data/NYC_Restaurant_Inspections.csv', but the data is not included here due to file size constraints.  The data on the NYC OpenData website is updated frequently with new restaurant inspection results.

#### Models
The logistic regression and gradient boosting models are saved in the [models](https://github.com/seanmurphy21/capstone_project/blob/main/models) folder.  The random forest model is not included here due to file size limits.
